== Project Result (Projektendergebnis):
The main benefit is that it can help you maximize registrations, while minimizing the resources that may otherwise have been needed. If you’re running multiple events, or a regularly occurring event, then this can be particularly useful.

Other features::
- Saves time needed for manual processing
